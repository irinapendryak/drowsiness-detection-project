# drowsiness-detection-project

Sleepy drivers are one of the frequent causes of car accidents. It is important to detect in advance if the state of a driver may lead to falling asleep and getting into a car accident.

The goal of our project is to identify whether the eyes of the drivers are open or closed on the pictures.

We use a drowsiness detection dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasadvpatil/mrl-dataset).
